# COSI-159A: Computer Vision
Implementation of SphereFace from SphereFace: Deep Hypersphere Embedding for Face Recognition 

Train and test the model on the LFW dataset using the split pairsDevTrain.txt and pairsDevTest.txt 
from http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/index.html.

Image data stored in ./data/lfw
Label files pairsDevTrain.txt and pairsDevTest.txt are in ./data/lfw

Model implementation from [SphereFace: Deep Hypersphere Embedding for Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08063)
