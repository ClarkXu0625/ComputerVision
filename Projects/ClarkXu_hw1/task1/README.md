# COSI-159A: Deep Learning Practice

COSI-159A: Computer Vision, 2023 Spring  
Additional classes inference.py and evaluation.py are written. The infer() and eval() functions are deleted from train.py

Run main.py to train, evaluate, and infer

The model would be trained for 10 Epoches.

After training, the model would evaluate the testing set and print the accuract in the console
It would also get random data from data/MNIST/testSet folder, print the predicted result along with the image.
Noted, close the image window to stop running main, otherwise it will still run.
