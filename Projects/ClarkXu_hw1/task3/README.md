For task3:
Run the code in test.py and test.ipynb
test.py contains verify, attribute detect, and face detect functions by importing deepface package
1. Face verification: verify(image1, image2), parameter image1 and image2 could be called from list image_names
2. Attribute analysis: analyze(image), parameter image is image path, same as above
3. Face detection: print_face(image_path), parameter image_path same as above, it would return the detected face range and print it out.

Make sure cd to task3 folder to run the code. Otherwise, you may need to type image path mannually.
